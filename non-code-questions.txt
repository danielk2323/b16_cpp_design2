2. 
Arrays: Fixed size(cannot change)
Vectors: Dynamic size
Arrays should be used when confident about the size and when performance is needed(arrays have less overhead)

4. Iterators: Generalization of pointers for containder containers(e.g lists, vectors, arrays)
Adavantage: Containder Independence
